# Repos overview and future plans

### Description

Once upon a time, I stumbled at someone's github project. It was a kind of interest to me, and I decided to look for others of his projects. But when I clicked on
Repositories tabs it was too many of them, and too terse description, so I started to open it one by one, but finally i gave up.  
The lesson is this.
