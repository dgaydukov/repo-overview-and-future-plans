# Repos overview and future plans

### Description

Once upon a time, I stumbled at someone's github project. It was a kind of interest to me, and I decided to look for others of his projects. But when I clicked on
Repositories tabs it was too many of them, and too terse description, so I started to open it one by one, but finally i gave up.

The moral of this story is that everybody who has more than 6 repos need a custom page with concise and clear explanation, what repo does, when it can be useful,
and how it is connected with other repos. We need also to know, what future plans does one have. So this repo is my attempt to implement such a strategy.

Node that plans are going to change from time to time.

### Overview

Although you can see my list of repos in the github [repo tabs](https://github.com/dgaydukov?tab=repositories), here I will present the full view of my repos.
How they are connected to each other. More over, below i will write my plans what i'm going to do in the coming months. Keep in mind that plans will change from time 
to time due to my actual execution of it.
The full overview you can read [here](https://github.com/dgaydukov/repos-overview-and-future-plans/blob/master/overview.md)
